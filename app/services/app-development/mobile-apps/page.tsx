        answer:
          "The timeline for mobile app development typically ranges from 3-6 months, depending on the complexity of the app, features required, and the platforms you're targeting. Simple apps may take less time, while complex applications with extensive features could take longer.",

        question: "What's the difference between native and cross-platform development?",
        answer:
          "Native development involves building apps specifically for a single platform (iOS or Android) using platform-specific languages and tools. This approach offers the best performance, access to all device features, and optimal user experience. Cross-platform development uses frameworks like React Native or Flutter to build apps that work on multiple platforms from a single codebase, which can be more cost-effective but may have some limitations in performance or feature access.",

Our maintenance packages include regular updates, bug fixes, performance optimization, and feature enhancements.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure app security?",
        answer:
          "We implement multiple layers of security including secure authentication, data encryption, secure API communication, code obfuscation, and regular security audits. We follow platform-specific security best practices and stay updated on the latest security threats and mitigation strategies.",
