        answer:
          "A Progressive Web App (PWA) is a type of application that combines the best features of web and mobile apps. PWAs are built using web technologies but offer app-like experiences such as working offline, push notifications, and device hardware access. They can be installed on the home screen without going through an app store.",
      },
      {
        question: "What are the advantages of PWAs over native apps?",
        answer:
          "PWAs offer several advantages: they don't require installation from an app store, they work across all platforms from a single codebase, they're discoverable through search engines, they take up less storage space, they update automatically, and they're generally more cost-effective to develop and maintain than native apps.",
      },
      {
        question: "Do PWAs work offline?",
        answer:
          "Yes, PWAs can work offline or in low-quality network conditions. Using service workers, PWAs can cache important resources and data, allowing users to continue using the application even without an internet connection. When the connection is restored, the app can synchronize any changes made offline.",
      },
      {
        question: "Can PWAs send push notifications?",
        answer:
          "Yes, PWAs can send push notifications on supported platforms, allowing you to re-engage users with timely and relevant information. This feature works on Android devices and on desktop browsers, with varying levels of support on iOS.",
