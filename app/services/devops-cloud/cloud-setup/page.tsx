        answer:
          "The best cloud provider depends on your specific needs. AWS offers the most comprehensive services and global reach. Azure integrates well with Microsoft products and is ideal for enterprises already using Microsoft technologies. Google Cloud excels in data analytics, machine learning, and containerization. We'll help you evaluate your requirements and choose the right provider or multi-cloud strategy.",

We follow the principle of least privilege and implement security at every layer of your cloud infrastructure.",

        question: "What is Infrastructure as Code and why is it important?",
        answer:
          "Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure through code rather than manual processes. It's important because it makes your infrastructure deployments consistent, repeatable, version-controlled, and auditable. IaC enables you to quickly replicate environments, implement disaster recovery, and scale efficiently while reducing human error.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do you optimize cloud costs?",
        answer:
          "We optimize cloud costs through several strategies: right-sizing resources to match actual needs, implementing auto-scaling to adjust capacity based on demand, utilizing reserved instances or savings plans for predictable workloads, identifying and removing unused resources, setting up cost monitoring and alerts, and continuously analyzing usage patterns to recommend optimizations.",
