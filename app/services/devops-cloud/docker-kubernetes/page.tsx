        question: "When should I use Kubernetes vs. simpler orchestration options?",
        answer:
          "Kubernetes is ideal for complex applications with multiple services that need advanced scaling, high availability, and automated failover. For simpler applications, lighter solutions like Docker Compose, AWS ECS, or managed container services might be more appropriate. We'll help you evaluate the complexity of your application and operational requirements to recommend the right orchestration solution.",

        question: "How do you handle stateful applications in Kubernetes?",
        answer:
          "We handle stateful applications in Kubernetes using StatefulSets and persistent volumes. We implement proper backup and recovery strategies, use operators for database workloads when appropriate, and design for data consistency and availability. For critical stateful workloads, we may recommend managed database services that integrate well with your Kubernetes environment.",

        question: "What's your approach to Kubernetes security?",
        answer:
          "Our Kubernetes security approach includes: securing the cluster with proper authentication and authorization; implementing network policies for service isolation; using security contexts and pod security policies; scanning container images for vulnerabilities; managing secrets securely; implementing runtime security monitoring; and regularly updating all components to address security vulnerabilities.",
