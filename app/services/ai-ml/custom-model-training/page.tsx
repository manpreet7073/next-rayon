      question: "Why would I need a custom AI model instead of using off-the-shelf solutions?",
      answer:
        "Custom AI models are beneficial when you have unique requirements, domain-specific data, or need higher performance than generic solutions can provide. They can be tailored to your specific business processes, terminology, and data characteristics, often resulting in significantly better performance for your particular use case.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much data do I need for custom model training?",
      answer:
        "The amount of data required depends on the complexity of the problem and the type of model. Some models can perform well with hundreds of examples, while others may require millions. We can advise on data requirements for your specific case and implement techniques like data augmentation and transfer learning to make the most of limited data.",
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to train a custom AI model?",
      answer:
        "Training time varies widely based on factors like data size, model complexity, and hardware resources. Simple models might train in hours, while complex deep learning models could take days or weeks. We provide estimates based on your specific requirements and can implement strategies to optimize training time.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can you help with data collection and labeling?",
      answer:
        "Yes, we offer comprehensive data services including data collection, cleaning, and labeling. We can help design data collection strategies, implement data pipelines, and set up efficient labeling workflows. For projects requiring large-scale labeling, we can also recommend and integrate with specialized data labeling services.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you ensure the quality and reliability of custom models?",
      answer:
        "We implement rigorous validation procedures including cross-validation, holdout test sets, and real-world testing. We also monitor for issues like overfitting, bias, and drift. Our deployment pipelines include continuous monitoring to detect performance degradation over time, ensuring your models remain reliable in production.",
