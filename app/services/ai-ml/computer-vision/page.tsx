      question: "What business problems can computer vision solve?",
      answer:
        "Computer vision can address numerous business challenges including: quality control in manufacturing, inventory management through object detection, security through surveillance and anomaly detection, customer analytics through facial recognition and behavior tracking, document processing through OCR, medical image analysis for diagnostics, and autonomous systems like self-driving vehicles or robots.",
    },
    {
      question: "How accurate are computer vision systems?",
      answer:
        "Modern computer vision systems can achieve very high accuracy, often exceeding 95% for well-defined tasks with good data. However, accuracy depends on factors like image quality, lighting conditions, model complexity, and training data. We work to optimize these factors and set realistic expectations based on your specific use case.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can computer vision work in real-time?",
      answer:
        "Yes, many computer vision applications can operate in real-time. We can optimize models for speed using techniques like model quantization, hardware acceleration (GPUs/TPUs), and efficient architectures. For edge devices with limited processing power, we can implement lightweight models specifically designed for real-time performance.",
    },
    {
      question: "What hardware is required for computer vision systems?",
      answer:
        "Hardware requirements vary based on the application. Cloud-based solutions can run on standard servers, while edge deployments might use specialized hardware like NVIDIA Jetson devices, Intel Neural Compute Sticks, or custom FPGA solutions. We can recommend the most cost-effective hardware configuration for your specific needs.",
    },
    {
      question: "How do you handle privacy concerns with computer vision?",
      answer:
        "We implement privacy-preserving techniques such as on-device processing to avoid sending sensitive data to the cloud, face blurring or anonymization, data encryption, and compliance with regulations like GDPR. We can also design systems that extract only the necessary information without storing raw images or videos.",
