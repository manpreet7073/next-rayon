        answer:
          "A custom LMS offers several advantages: it can be tailored to your specific teaching methodology and workflow; it can integrate seamlessly with your existing systems; it can support unique content types or assessment methods not available in standard LMS platforms; it provides complete control over features and user experience; and it can scale according to your specific needs without forcing you into predefined pricing tiers.",

        question: "How long does it take to develop a custom LMS?",
        answer:
          "The development timeline for a custom LMS typically ranges from 4-8 months, depending on the complexity and scope of features. A basic LMS with core functionality might take 3-4 months, while a comprehensive system with advanced features could take 6-12 months. We can provide a more specific timeline after understanding your requirements in detail.",

        question: "Can you migrate content from our existing LMS?",
        answer:
          "Yes, we can help migrate content from your existing LMS to your new custom platform. We develop migration strategies and tools specific to your current system, whether it's Moodle, Canvas, Blackboard, or another platform. We ensure that course content, user data, and learning records are transferred accurately while taking the opportunity to improve organization and structure.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure the security of learner data?",
        answer:
          "We implement multiple layers of security including secure authentication with role-based access control, encryption of sensitive data both in transit and at rest, regular security audits and penetration testing, compliance with relevant standards like GDPR or FERPA, secure API implementations, and comprehensive logging and monitoring. We also provide documentation on security practices for administrators.",
