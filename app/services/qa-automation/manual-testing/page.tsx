        question: "Why is manual testing still important in the age of automation?",
        answer:
          "Manual testing remains crucial because it brings human intuition, creativity, and adaptability that automated tests can't replicate. Manual testers can evaluate subjective aspects like user experience, visual design, and intuitiveness. They can perform exploratory testing to discover unexpected issues, adapt to changing requirements quickly, and provide valuable feedback on usability. The most effective QA strategy combines both manual and automated testing approaches.",
      },
      {
        question: "What types of manual testing do you perform?",
        answer:
          "We perform various types of manual testing including functional testing (verifying features work as expected), usability testing (evaluating user experience), exploratory testing (discovering unexpected issues), regression testing (ensuring new changes don't break existing functionality), compatibility testing (checking performance across browsers and devices), accessibility testing (verifying usability for people with disabilities), and localization testing (validating international adaptations). We tailor our testing approach to your specific project needs.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do you document and report issues found during manual testing?",
        answer:
          "We use a structured approach to document issues, including detailed bug reports with severity and priority ratings, steps to reproduce, expected vs. actual results, screenshots or videos demonstrating the issue, environment details, and any relevant logs or data. We typically use issue tracking systems like JIRA or TestRail to manage the reporting process, ensuring clear communication with your development team and providing metrics on testing progress and quality.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do you prioritize what to test manually vs. automate?",
        answer:
          "We prioritize manual testing for areas requiring human judgment such as UI/UX evaluation, exploratory testing of new features, complex scenarios that are difficult to automate, and infrequently changing functionality. We recommend automation for repetitive tasks, regression testing, data-driven tests, performance testing, and high-risk critical paths. Our goal is to create an optimal balance that maximizes test coverage and efficiency while minimizing costs.",
