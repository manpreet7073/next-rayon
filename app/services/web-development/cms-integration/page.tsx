        answer:
          "The best CMS depends on your specific needs. WordPress is excellent for small to medium-sized businesses with its user-friendly interface and extensive plugin ecosystem. Drupal offers more robust capabilities for complex, enterprise-level sites. Headless CMS options like Contentful or Strapi are ideal for multi-channel content delivery. We'll help you evaluate factors like content complexity, technical requirements, budget, and team capabilities to recommend the most suitable platform.",

        question: "What is a headless CMS and when should I use it?",
        answer:
          "A headless CMS separates the content management backend from the frontend presentation layer. Content is delivered via APIs rather than being tightly coupled with the frontend. This approach is ideal when you need to deliver content to multiple platforms (web, mobile, IoT devices), want greater flexibility in frontend technologies, require high performance for content-heavy sites, or need to future-proof your content strategy as new channels emerge.",

        question: "Can you migrate content from our existing website to a new CMS?",

          "Yes, we specialize in content migration between different CMS platforms. We develop custom migration scripts to transfer content while preserving relationships, metadata, and media assets. We handle complex migrations including content restructuring, URL mapping for SEO preservation, and user data transfer. Our process includes thorough testing and validation to ensure all content is migrated accurately.",
      },
      {
        question: "How do you ensure our CMS is secure?",
        answer:
          "We implement multiple security measures including regular updates to the CMS core and plugins, secure authentication with strong password policies and two-factor authentication, proper user role configuration, security plugins and firewalls, malware scanning, secure hosting configurations, and regular security audits. We also provide security best practices training for your content team to maintain ongoing protection.",
